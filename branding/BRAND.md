# RipCat Brand Guide

## Story
A tide app built by Ben Williamson, his daughter Odette, and their cat Rip — a brown/grey tabby with the energy of a cat who's seen bigger waves and is not impressed.

## Mascot: Rip
- **Species:** Brown/grey tabby cat
- **Key features:** Dark stripe pattern, prominent M-marking on forehead, green-gold half-lidded eyes, stocky build
- **Expression:** Chill, slightly unimpressed, "cool but over it"
- **Outfit:** Navy blue Santa Barbara Surf Shop hoodie (hood framing ears)
- **Art style:** Pete the Cat — bold outlines, flat color fills, expressive but simple
- **Reference photos:** `reference/rip-and-odette.jpg`, `reference/rip-closeup.jpg`

## Logo Partnership
- **Santa Barbara Surf Shop** — "surfboards by Yater" (Rip's hoodie logo)
- **Reference:** `reference/sb-surf-shop-logo.jpg`
- **Status:** Pending rights approval from shop owners (Ben has personal connection)
- **Usage:** On Rip's hoodie in mascot illustrations, potentially in-app credits
